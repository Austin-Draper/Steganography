This program was tested using Python 2.7.12 on a Windows 10 OS. 
The program consumes a .jpg and creates a copy of it as a .png. 
The .png shares the same name as the .jpg except for a enc_ added to the front of the name. 

To run this program on Linux or Mac, open your terminal in the same directory as the program 
and type: 
python encryption_project.py

On Windows, open a command line in the same directory as the script and type: 
py -2 encryption_project.py

You will be prompted to enter a 1 to encrypt, 2 to decrypt, or anything else to quit.

Enter the number 1 to Encrypt a .jpg.

Enter the name of your .jpg including the extension such as "oprah.jpg" without the quotes.

Enter the name of your text file including the extension to read the message from it such as "testing.txt" without the quotes.

You will be prompted for a number again. This time enter the number 2 to Decrypt that picture.

Enter the name of the png that was just created. In the case of "oprah.jpg" it would now be "enc_oprah.png" without the quotes.

SUCCESS! You should now see your hidden text that was encrypted. 

The message on your terminal has also been written to a text file called "output.txt".

From here, you can now enter a 1 to encrypt again, enter a 2 to decrypt another encrypted picture, or press any other key to
exit the program.
